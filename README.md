A small collection of dart and flutter libraries inspired by tools such as SWR, RTKQuery, React Query, Urql and apollo
from the React world.

Cache any the response of any asynchronous function (usually external api requests) for a fast and snappy user
experience.

The repo is made of three packages:

* The base package, [Cached Query](https://github.com/D-James-GH/cached_query/tree/main/packages/cached_query), has no flutter dependencies and can therefore be used in any dart project. 
* [Cached Query Flutter](https://github.com/D-James-GH/cached_query/tree/main/packages/cached_query_flutter) adds some useful flutter tools such as 
connectivity re-fetching and focus re-fetching. 
* [Cached Storage](https://github.com/D-James-GH/cached_query/tree/main/packages/cached_storage) is a persistent storage addon for flutter apps.
